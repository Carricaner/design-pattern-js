# Design Pattern Project

- This project contains some design patterns concept & implementations, whcih now is mainly JS.
- Basically, JavaScript belongs to command-typed languaged, so even if there are some syntaxes which can be used to declare "Object" like Java, it is still originated from the prototype-chained ones underneath.
- Hence, it's going to be funny to use JavaScript to implement design patterns haha.
